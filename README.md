# ORM-eCommerce-Backend
    
## Description
This project used starter code to build the backend for an ecommerce website. Starting with a database, I used API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to allow the user to edit information in the database. In the video below, you can see the functionality being demonstrated as I call POST routes on each page to view the database information attached to it. Not only did I have to fully build out the API routes, but also set the parameters for the database models and add associations within the database to describe how the various models interact with each other.

## Installation

This model uses dotenv, JSON, SQL, Sequelize, Insomnia, and node in order to run properly. You can download each by running npm install in your terminal, after downloading the reference material.
